# Project Setup

Designing your dapps, setting up your projects, and learning the workflows to manage them is no trivial task. The goal of the Project Setup section is to give developers the building blocks that are necessary to get a successful project running.

This section is work-in-progress and incomplete. As best practices and design patterns evolve for building dapps that run on the Internet Computer, the information included here will also evolve and change accordingly.
